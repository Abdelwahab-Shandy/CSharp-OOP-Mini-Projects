# Programming Challenges - C# Using OOP Only

Welcome to **Programming Challenges - C# Using OOP Only**! üéâ  
This project is designed to help you master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in **C#** through practical and engaging challenges.

---

## üìù Description

This project focuses on strengthening your understanding of OOP principles by solving various programming challenges. Each challenge highlights one or more of the following OOP pillars:

1. **Encapsulation**: Manage access to data using properties and methods.  
2. **Inheritance**: Reuse and organize code efficiently through parent and child classes.  
3. **Polymorphism**: Implement flexible and scalable solutions using interfaces and method overriding.  
4. **Abstraction**: Simplify complex systems using abstract classes and interfaces.
